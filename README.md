# Bot Battlr

Bot Battlr is a React application that empowers users to assemble their own Bot Army. This platform offers users the ability to explore a catalog of available bots, examine their profiles, and enlist them into their army. With Bot Battlr, users can efficiently manage their enlisted bots, release them from service, and even permanently discharge them.

## Features

- **Browse Available Bots**: Users can browse through a list of available bots, each with its own unique profile.
- **Enlist Bots**: Users can enlist bots into their army by selecting them from the available list.
- **Manage Bot Army**: Enlisted bots are displayed in a separate section where users can manage their army efficiently.
- **Release Bots**: Users can release bots from their army, removing them from the enlisted bots section.
- **Discharge Bots**: Users have the option to permanently discharge bots from service. This action deletes the bot both from the frontend and the backend.
